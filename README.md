My Tetris

## Task
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow.[3] He derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport. 
The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines are cleared at once.

## Description
Tetris was the first game to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States, where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The game is a popular use of tetrominoes, the four-element case of polyominoes, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
It's your turn to create a Tetris Implementation. This project is a demonstration of your JavaScript skills and only JavaScript. (No Library, except Math).
Technical Part
Tetris is a game, you should Google Game Architecture.
A game is full of events and, JavaScript is a language very powerful with events. :-)

## Installation
Playfield is 10×40, where rows above 20 are hidden or obstructed by the field frame to trick the player into thinking it's 10×20. In 2002 Guideline, it could be at least 22 height.
If hardware permits it, a few pixels of row 21 will be visible.
Tetrimino colors are as follows.
Cyan I
Yellow O
Purple T
Green S
Red Z
Blue J
Orange L
In versions that use monochrome screens, or when hardware limitations disallow all colors to be used, the Tetriminos should have distinct hues and patterns to differentiate themselves.
